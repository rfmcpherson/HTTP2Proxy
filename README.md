# HTTP2Proxy

UNFINISHED: a work in progress.

An HTTP/2 proxy for Python 3. 
It currently relies on nghttp for compression and pymiproxy for the SSL signer. I do not own the license for signer.py.

TODO:
* Get basic proxy working
* Get basic unit tests set up
* Extend proxy functionality
* Add unit tests
* Repeat
